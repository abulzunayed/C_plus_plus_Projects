**Purpose of the project:** Prepare images captured from a Webcam/ local drive so that we can use some computer vision techniques.

**Prerequisites environment:** VS code editor, Visual Studio compiler 2022,  CMake build engine V_3.30.0, OpenCV library v_4.10.0 windows.

**Usage libraries:**  #include<opencv2/imgcodecs.hpp>,  #include<opencv2/highgui.hpp>, #include<opencv2/imgproc.hpp>

**Debugging:**  C/c++: g++.exe build and debug active file( Compiler tools: MSYS2-64)

**What have I learned from implementing this project ??**
    - Webcam image/ video detection.
    - Color picker from images.
    - Convert to Grayscale, Gaussian Blurr, Canny, Image Dialation, Erode, Resize, Rescaling, crop image.
    -  Draw shape and text on images.
    -  Warp images.
    -  Color detection on image.
    -  Contour/shape detection.
