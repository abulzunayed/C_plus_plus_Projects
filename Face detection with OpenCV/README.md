**Computer vision has taken giant strides in recent years, and one fascinating application is face detection.**

- Face detection using Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifier.
  Haar Cascade Classifier: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades
- The OpenCV libraries on CMake cross-platform with Visual Studio Code have been used.
- The following tasks were implemented:
   - Section 1: Initializing the Webcam.
   - Section 2: Loading the Face Detection Model from pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier.
   - Section 3: Real-time Face Detection Loop.
