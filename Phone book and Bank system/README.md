 **Project 1: Create address Phone Book**
 
- What have I learned from implementing this project ??
  - We defined an OOP struct to store the name, phone, and email of each contact.
  - We use a vector of Contact structs to store the list of contacts.
  - The addContact function allows users to add a new contact to the contact book.
  - The displayContacts function lists all contacts in the contact book.
  - The searchContact function looks for a contact by name and displays it if found.
  - The deleteContact removes a contact from the list based on the name.


 **Project 2: Simple Bank Management System**


- What have I learned from implementing this project ??
 - How do you define a bank account with a basic registration system, deposit, withdraw money, and balance check?
 - We provided public methods (deposit, withdraw, display) for account operations.
 - The switch statement in the main function handles user choices for banking operations.
