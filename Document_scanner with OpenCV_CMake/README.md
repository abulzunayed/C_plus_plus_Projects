Document scanner is the process of using computer vision techniques to automatically scan the document.

- The OpenCV libraries on Cmake cross-platform with Visual Studio Code have been used.
- The following tasks were implemented :
  - Convert original image to Gray, Blurr and Canny Images.
  - Detect the Shape/ Contour of the image.
  - Again draw new contour points on a new image.
  - Reorder contour points.
  - Warp and crop image.
