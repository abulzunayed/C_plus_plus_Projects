Purpose of the project: **Virtual paint board where you can write with the virtual pen on webcam live video. 
First, the webcam creates a virtual open board, then the program automatically picks up the color from the webcam-detected pen color.  
Finally, the program creates a pointer and we can able to write on the virtual board of webcam.**


- What have I learned from implementing this project ??
     - Capture webcam video.
     - Find pen color from webcam-detected pen.
     - Detect and color picker.
     - Create a contour of images.
     - Create a pointer on the virtual board.
     - Draw canvas with the pointer.

 - Prerequisites environment: VS code editor, Visual Studio compiler 2022, CMake build engine V_3.30.0, OpenCV library v_4.10.0 windows.

 - Usage libraries: #include<opencv2/imgcodecs.hpp>, #include<opencv2/highgui.hpp>, #include<opencv2/imgproc.hpp>

 - Debugging: C/c++: g++.exe build and debug active file( Compiler tools: MSYS2-64)
