**Linear Regression using C++**
Letâ€™s first get a brief idea about what linear regression is and how it works before we implement it using C++.
Linear regression models are used to predict the value of one factor based on the value of another factor. The value being predicted is called the dependent variable and the value that is used to predict the dependent variable is called an independent variable. The mathematical equation of linear regression is:

Y=B0+B1 X

**Logistic Regression with C++**
Logistic Regression is one of the most famous machine learning algorithms for binary classification. This is because it is a simple algorithm that performs very well on a wide range of problems.

The name of this algorithm is logistic regression because of the logistic function that we use in this algorithm. This logistic function is defined as:

predicted = 1 / (1 + e^-x)
