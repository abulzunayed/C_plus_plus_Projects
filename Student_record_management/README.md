**Project name: Create a minimalist desktop app for Student Record Management System**

Functionalities of this App feature:
  - Records are saved directly on an Excel file to decrease data Entry labor costs and improve efficiency.
  - launch the srm.exe file directly to use the App.
  - Make two separate account systems: (1) Admin has full access to manipulate the data, (2)Student accounts can only view the data.
  - Create a password-protected system: both accounts of  passwords are set to "password".
